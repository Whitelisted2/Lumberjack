## Lumberjack: Course Project for Data Structures and Algorithms (CS2x1) @ IIT Dharwad
- You can find the detailed problem statement [here](https://www.optil.io/optilion/problem/3000).
- Our main methods focus on Domino Effect and Profit/Time ratio, and we take an overall-greedy (although optimized) approach.
- A theoretical analysis of our algorithm has been included in the project report.
